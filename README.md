# RFID_Scanner

An RFID scanner that sends an emailed report to specified users. In the report, the users will receive an email detailing if the correct RFID tag was used when the tag was scanners, the data from the tag, as well as an image captured during the scanning process. It works by first scanning the tag, then iterating through the list of approved IDs, and sending the appropriate email if it was or wasnâ€™t accepted.
